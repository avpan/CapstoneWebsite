        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="lead">League of Legends (LoL) is known as a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena or MOBA. It is a game played by millions of players through the internet. Each player controls a champion and engages with the opposing team to destroy that team's nexus.</p>
        <p class="lead">Teams are consisted of 5v5, and the games include many game mode varieties for the user base. One of these modes is a competitive rank mode. Players play each other in a mode that grants or removes the players league points (lp) and gaining enough lp qualifies players to advance rankings. Understanding the win conditions and most effective way to win matches for those in competitive rankings is naturally desired.</p>
        <p class="lead">One of the best,reliable metrics to determine a team's success in a LoL match is the gold earned by the team during the course of the game. Gold is the game's main currency, which can be used to purchase items that increase the power and survivability of a player's champion. Gold is obtained through killing minions, killing enemy champions, assisting in enemy champion kills, and destroying objectives.</p>
        <p class="lead">The project uses Riot Games' API, which allows the collection of data about summoners (LoL players), champions, and matches. The data gathering process is explained more in the Data section.</p>
        <p class="lead">After much thought, I decided that the best way to showcase my data science skills is learn and implement machine learning in order to predict the chances of a team's chance of winning a game of League of Legends before the game ends, based on different metrics that can affect a team's chance at success</p>
